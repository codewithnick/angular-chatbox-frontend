commit 1:

first I changed the hardcoded message values and initalised the messages using the constructor
in messenger-chat.components.ts

then I updated the model of message to hold a extra attribute called timeStamp of type Date
in messenger-chatbox.model.ts

then I updated the message objects to hold the timeStamp attribute
in messenger-chat.component.ts

then I updated the html to display the timeStamp
in messenger-chat.component.html

commit 2:
added minor css changes to fit responders input

commit 3:
solved this bug:
Error: NG0100: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: Expression has changed after it was checked. Previous value: 'false'. Current value: 'true'. Expression location: MessengerChatHeadComponent component. Find more at https://angular.io/errors/NG0100

by moving the subscriber function into the constructor , 
so it is called only once
while the component is initialised
and not after

commit 4:
added gilroy font globally

commit 5:
added the ability to send messages with files
modified user message model and created a custom file model
export interface userMessages {
    content: string;
    type: string;
    file: myFile;
    timeStamp: Date
}
export interface myFile{
    file?: any;
    fileUrl?: any;
    fileIcon?: string;
}
instead of pushing the message directly to the messages array when uploading the file ,
I created a fileBuffer which stores the file and a div to preview uploaded filename 
and then when the user clicks send
the fileBuffer is pushed to the messages array along with the message in the textbox
even if the textbox is empty

commit 6:
some random design improvements

by adding touchStartPreventDefault: false to swiperOptions

commit 8:

made changes accordingly in chat and head components to 
load all users from constants.userlist and 
made changes in chat component to generate messages for each user
