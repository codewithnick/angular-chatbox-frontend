commit 1:

first I changed the hardcoded message values and initalised the messages using the constructor
in messenger-chat.components.ts

then I updated the model of message to hold a extra attribute called timeStamp of type Date
in messenger-chatbox.model.ts

then I updated the message objects to hold the timeStamp attribute
in messenger-chat.component.ts

then I updated the html to display the timeStamp
in messenger-chat.component.html

commit 2:
added minor css changes to fit responders input

commit 3:
solved this bug:
Error: NG0100: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: Expression has changed after it was checked. Previous value: 'false'. Current value: 'true'. Expression location: MessengerChatHeadComponent component. Find more at https://angular.io/errors/NG0100

by moving the subscriber function into the constructor , 
so it is called only once
while the component is initialised
and not after
